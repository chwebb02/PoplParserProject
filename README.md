# Parser Project
This repo contains my implemenntation for the Python parser project for the Principles of Programming Languages class at MU.  The main file is parser.py.

## Team Members
- Chase Webb

## Requirements
Antlr4 is required (project was build with version 4.9.2)

## How to use/run
To run the program, run the python file parser.py and supply a filepath as an argument for the parser to parse.  It will then print out the parse tree and the success status of the parsing operation.
